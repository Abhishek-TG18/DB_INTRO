	A database is an organized collection of data that is stored and accessed electronically. Databases are designed to manage
 large amounts of information efficiently and allow for quick retrieval and manipulation of that data.

Why We Need a Database

Organization: Databases help organize data in a structured manner, making it easy to find and manage.

Efficiency: They allow for quick retrieval, insertion, updating, and deletion of data.

Data Integrity: Databases ensure that data is accurate and consistent through constraints and rules.

Security: They provide mechanisms to protect data from unauthorized access and ensure data privacy.

Scalability: Databases can handle large volumes of data and can scale as the amount of data grows.

Data Sharing: They enable multiple users and applications to access and manipulate data simultaneously.


Example of a Database
Let's consider an example of an online bookstore. Here's how a database would be used:

Tables: The database would have multiple tables to store different types of information:

Books: Contains details about each book (e.g., ISBN, title, author, price, stock).
Customers: Stores customer information (e.g., customer ID, name, email, address).
Orders: Keeps records of customer orders (e.g., order ID, customer ID, order date, total amount).
OrderItems: Details of items in each order (e.g., order ID, book ID, quantity, price).
Relationships: The tables would be related to each other. For instance:

Each order is linked to a customer through the customer ID.
Each order is linked to the books purchased through the order ID and book ID.
Queries: The database allows for queries to retrieve information, such as:

List of all books in stock.
Details of a specific customerâ€™s order history.
Total sales for a particular month.
